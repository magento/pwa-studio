### Extensible payment methods

Two new extensions points for the Venia UI package have been added in this release.

the [`summaryPagePaymentTypes`][] target lets you add a custom payment summary in the checkout summary page.

### Accessibility

Keyboard focus and navigation now work as expected on the layered navigation UI feature.
With the Filter modal open, users can press the `Tab` key to navigate across filter items such as "Price" and "Color".
On filter items, the user can press `Space` to open and navigate through the options with `Tab`.
Options are toggled using the `Space` key.

### Layered Navigation

To help deliver a better customer experience, filtering products by their attributes on the product listing page has been optimized for desktop views.
The changes included in this release focuses on improving how the user interacts with the layered navigation feature when filtering products.
For example, filter options can be neatly collapsed and the product listing is automatically updated whenever the user selects a filter option.

### Cypress tests

[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is an end-to-end testing suite written in JavaScript.
This release adds this framework to the PWA Studio project to increase testing automation and reduce the time spent on manual testing.
This will enable the team to release new versions faster and more often.

Integration tests for PageBuilder and the new Wish List feature are included in this release.
These tests are part of Venia's integration tests.
If you want to use these tests in your own CICD pipeline, they can be found in [this directory][].

## Known issues

- The URL for the suggested category search result contains two store codes (for example, `default`) instead of one. For example: https://venia.magento.com/default/default/search.html?page=1&query=selena&category. This results in a 404 (page not found) error when selecting a suggested category from the search. This issue has been fixed in [PR #3344](https://github.com/magento/pwa-studio/pull/3344).

- The `yarn watch` process may run out of memory if left running for an extended amount of time.
  If an error occurs because of this, restart the watcher.
