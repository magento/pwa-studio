# Release 12.1.0

**NOTE:**
_This changelog only contains release notes for PWA Studio and Venia 12.1.0_
_For older release notes, see_ [PWA Studio releases][].

## New Features

-  **Added PWA Studio metapackages** — In this release, we introduce our [PWA Studio metapackages][]: One for [Magento Open Source][] and one for [Adobe Commerce][]. These metapackages provide a new way to add any additional Open Source or Commerce features needed by your PWA modules. The PWA Studio team will also use these metapackages to add new features to the Open Source and Commerce code bases as needed. In fact, we did that in this release. We extended the GraphQL schema to include a new mutation and query as well as new fields that provide more details when a cart item error occurs.

    **UPDATES REQUIRED!** This release and all future PWA Studio releases will have dependencies on these metapackages. That means you need to add one or both of the metapackages to your PWA apps (depending on your backend target). Instructions for installing these packages are in the README files for each metapackage repo:

    **For Open Source backends**: Install the [PWA Magento Open Source metapackage][].

    **For Adobe Commerce backends**: Install the [PWA Adobe Commerce metapackage][].

-  **Added new PWA Tailwind theming to Venia Header** — Refactored the Venia site `Header` component to use our new [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) theming framework. The `Header` component is the first component to use our theming framework. Other components will follow in the coming releases.

-  **Added a GraphQL mutation for submitting the Contact Us form.** — You can now use the `contactUs` mutation to submit the Contact Us form data to the Open Source or Commerce backend.

-  **Added GraphQL `storeConfig` fields** — Use the `contact_enabled` and `newsletter_enabled` fields in a `storeConfig` query to determine whether the Contact Us and Newsletter features are enabled.

-  **Added GraphQL schema to expose the error status of cart items** — The `CartItemInterface` now contains the `errors` field, which uses the `CartItemError` data type to return an error code and message.

## Bug fixes

-  [3464][] — **Cart**: Fixed an issue that prevented users from updating item quantities and removing items from the cart when using Magento 2.4-develop and 2.4.3 backends.
-  [3447][] — **Cart**: Fixed a rendering issue where out-of-stock products in your cart could not be removed.
-  [3495][] — **Cart**: Fixed issues that occurred when accessing the same store from different browser tabs or windows. To fix the problem, we introduced a storage listener on the cart context that fires a page reload whenever the `cartId` changes from another tab. Reloading the page forces Redux to persist a new `cartId` in storage.
-  [3535][] — **Cart**: Fixed a regression issue (during 12.1.0 development) that prevented the Add to Cart button from working on simple products featured on the Venia Home page.
-  [3513][] — **Mega Menu**: Fixed broken `Header` style when using the `develop` branch in a scaffolded project.
-  [3463][] — **Scaffolding CLI**: Fixed the Venia `_buildpack/create.js` `DEBUG_PROJECT_CREATION` test flag that broke when using NPM versions >=`7.23`.

## Metapackage introduction and updates

As mentioned above, we not only introduced metapackages in this release, we used them! Our fix for the cart rendering issue ([3447][]) required new GraphQL fields that we added to the metapackages. These new fields require you to install one or both of our metapackages into your PWA apps (depending on your backend target). If you missed the links provided above, here they are again:

**For Open Source backends**: Install the [PWA Magento Open Source metapackage][].

**For Adobe Commerce backends**: Install the [PWA Adobe Commerce metapackage][].

## Documentation updates

-  **Metapackage Installation**: Added instructions for installing our new metapackages for both local and cloud-based environments. The instructions have been added to the READMEs of the Open Source and Commerce repos: [PWA Magento Open Source metapackage][] and [PWA Adobe Commerce metapackage][].

## Known Issues

No known issues.

## Test Updates

-  [3460][] — Added Docker parallelization for Cypress testing to cut testing times by 50%. When run synchronously, the whole suite of tests took about 30 minutes. Now it takes 13–15 minutes.

-  [3506][] - Fixed outdated snapshots for failing Page Builder tests on the `develop` branch. The tests started failing when the Newsletter form was added to the footer.
