/**
 * Handle unhandled errors by setting a global error state.
 *
 * "store slice" reducers may want to handle errors in a custom way, in order
 * to display more specific error states (such as form field validation).
 *
 * These reducers can indicate that an error is handled and needs no more UI
 * response, by assigning the error object to the `error` property on their
 * store slice.
 *
 * This reducer activates when the action has an `error` property. It then
 * checks each store slice for an `error` property which equals the error in
 * the action, indicating that the error has already been handled. If it
 * detects that the error is not present in any store slice, it assumes the
 * error is unhandled and pushes it into an `errors` array property on the root
 * store.
 *
 * This `errors` collection represents unhandled errors to be displayed in the
 * next render. To dismiss an error, dispatch the ERROR_DISMISS action with the
 * error as payload, and this reducer will remove it from the array.
 *
