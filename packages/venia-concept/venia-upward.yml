# This is the UPWARD specification file for the Venia storefront.
# It is used by an UPWARD server implementation, such as upward-js and
# upward-php, to describe how the server responds to requests.
# See: https://magento-research.github.io/pwa-studio/technologies/upward/

# The root properties of an UPWARD spec file are part of a global context
# that includes request and environment data.
# These properties are available to other properties and are ultimately
# populated with Resolvers.

# The root 'status', 'headers', and 'body' properties are required properties
# in an UPWARD spec file.
# An UPWARD server uses the resolved values of these properties to create an
# HTTP response to the client.
# In this file, these properties get their values from a top-level 
# 'response' object, which is a recommended and best practice approach.
status: response.status
headers: response.headers
body: response.body

# This is a top-level object used to set values for the root `status`,
# `headers`, and `body` properties.
# It is the first branch in an abstract decision tree, which ultimately 
# resolves to an object that contains values for its own 'status', 'headers',
# and 'body' properties.
# This object uses a ConditionalResolver to determine the object value based 
# on the URL pattern in the request object.
