# This is the UPWARD specification file for the Venia storefront.
# It is used by an UPWARD server implementation, such as upward-js and
# upward-php, to describe how the server responds to requests.
# See: https://pwastudio.io/technologies/upward/

# The root properties of an UPWARD spec file are part of a global context
# that includes request and environment data.
# These properties are available to other properties and are ultimately
# populated with Resolvers.

# The root 'status', 'headers', and 'body' properties are required properties
# in an UPWARD spec file.
# An UPWARD server uses the resolved values of these properties to create an
# HTTP response to the client.
# In this file, these properties get their values from a top-level
# 'response' object, which is a recommended and best practice approach.
status: veniaResponse.status
headers: veniaResponse.headers
body: veniaResponse.body

# These are no-ops at runtime; nothing refers to these context values in the
# rest of this file. They exist to declare that the files in the `./static`
# directory are required and should be copied into the build assets by the
# UpwardIncludePlugin. Since they are not directly mentioned elsewhere in this
# file or any other upward.yml file in the build, the UpwardIncludePlugin would
# fail to copy them if they were not mentioned here.

# The static directory includes files which don't need to be compiled.
# They are served by the `veniaStatic` DirectoryResolver, along with the
# bundles and other assets, but since that resolver serves the `.` dist
# directory, the UpwardIncludePlugin will not copy it to avoid circular
# dependency. TODO: This is kind of confusing.
staticIncludes:
  resolver: directory
  directory:
    resolver: inline
