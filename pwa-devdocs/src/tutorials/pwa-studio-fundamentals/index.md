## Prerequisites

### Node 12 deprecation warning

If you are using Node 12, you may see the following deprecation warning in the log when you run `yarn watch:venia`.

```sh
(node:89176) [DEP0066] DeprecationWarning: OutgoingMessage.prototype._headers is deprecated

This is caused by a project dependency used by PWA Studio and not by PWA Studio itself.
