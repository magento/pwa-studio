PWA Studio is a library of tools and packages designed to help you create a Magento PWA storefront.
In this section you will learn how to set up your storefront project using the scaffolding tool and learn about the different files and folders in your project.

## Prerequisites

-   A basic understanding of working with [React][]
-   Node >= 10.14.1
-   Yarn (recommended) or NPM

### Node 12 deprecation warning

If you are using Node 12, you may see the following deprecation warning in the log when you run `yarn watch:venia`.

```sh
(node:89176) [DEP0066] DeprecationWarning: OutgoingMessage.prototype._headers is deprecated
```

This is caused by a project dependency used by PWA Studio and not by PWA Studio itself.
