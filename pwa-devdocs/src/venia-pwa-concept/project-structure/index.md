This topic is an overview of the [`venia-concept`][] project structure.
It provides overview information about important directories and files to help you understand the different pieces of the project.

The Venia PWA storefront isn't a traditional Magento Theme like the Blank and Luma themes and therefore differs from the traditional [Magento theme structure][].
It's not part of a Magento code base but a separate instance that communicates with Magento through the [UPWARD][] middleware.

## Root directory files

In addition to the NPM packages.json and Venia specific validation and testing files, the root directory contains the following important files:

[`deployVeniaSampleData.sh`][]
: This file helps you to [Install Venia sample data][] into your Magento installation.
  Copy and execute this file in a Magento instance to install the sample data.

[`server.js`][]
: A node script that runs the UPWARD staging server when the `yarn run stage:venia` command is used.

[`venia-upward.yml`][]
: The [UPWARD server specification][] for the Venia PWA storefront.
  This file describes the server behavior for the middle tier service between the PWA and Magento.

[`webpack.config.js`][]

: This file contains all [Webpack][] configuration for bundling Venia static assets for both development and production deploys.

## The [`templates`][] directory

The `templates` directory contains [mustache][] template partials.
The UPWARD server combines these templates to create an application shell for different page types.

## The [`venia-static`][] directory

The `venia-static` directory contains the `favicon.ico` icon file, `icons` folder, `robots.txt` file, and other static files. The `upward.yml` config file file uses an UPWARD DirectoryResolver to serve the files in this directory as static resources.

## The [`src`][] directory

The `src` directory contains the PWA source code for the Venia theme, which are split into functional subdirectories.

### `src/index.js`

The `src/index.js` file is the entry point of Venia.
It sets the ApolloProvider, the ReduxStore, and the Router configuration and App Component.

### `src/store.js`

The `src/store.js` file is responsible for creating a Redux store.
It also combines Redux reducers and middlewares.

### `src/sw.js`

The `src/sw.js` file contains the service worker configuration.
