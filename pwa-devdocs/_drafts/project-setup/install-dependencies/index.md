title: Install project dependencies
---

In the [previous topic], you created the basic directory structure and files for a Magento theme.
In this topic you will initialize the `package.json` file and install project dependencies for your Magento PWA theme.

## Initialize and define the package configuration file

1. The following command uses `npm` to create your project's `package.json` file using default project values:

   ``` bash
   npm init -y
   ```

1. Run the following command to install [peregrine] and [React] as a production dependency:

   ``` bash
   npm install --save @magento/peregrine \
   react react-dom react-redux react-router-dom redux@3
   ```

   These dependencies allow you to use the hooks, components, and services provided by the peregrine project to develop your theme.

1. Run the following command to install [pwa-buildpack] and its standard peer dependencies:

   ``` bash
   npm install --save-dev @magento/pwa-buildpack \
   babel-core babel-loader babel-helper-module-imports \
   babel-plugin-syntax-jsx babel-plugin-transform-class-properties \
   babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx \
   webpack@3 webpack-dev-server@2
   ```

   These dependencies allow you to create a [Webpack]-based build environment for your project.

   It also installs [Babel], a JavaScript transpiler and modifier that allows you to write code using the latest and custom JavaScript language features without having to worry about browser compatibility.

1. **Optional** Run the following command to install the `dotenv` module:

   ``` bash
   npm install --save-dev dotenv
   ```

   This tutorial uses the `dotenv` module to load environment values from a `.env` file and to separate environment-specific values from source code.

   Using this module is not a requirement for working with PWA studios, but
   it is good practice to use this or other similar tools for managing environment variables across different platforms.

## Review `package.json` content

Now that you have your project dependencies installed, your `package.json` file should look like the following:

``` json
{
  "name": "orange-theme",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "@magento/peregrine": "^0.1.5-alpha",
    "react": "^16.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^16.3.1",
    "react-redux": "^5.0.7",
    "react-router-dom": "^4.2.2",
    "redux": "^3.7.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@magento/pwa-buildpack": "^0.2.0",
    "babel-core": "^6.26.0",
    "babel-helper-module-imports": "^7.0.0-beta.3",
    "babel-loader": "^7.1.4",
    "babel-plugin-syntax-jsx": "^6.18.0",
    "babel-plugin-transform-class-properties": "^6.24.1",
    "babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread": "^6.26.0",
    "babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx": "^6.24.1",
    "dotenv": "^5.0.1",
    "webpack": "^3.11.0",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^2.11.0"
  }
}
```
