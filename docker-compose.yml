services:
  # proxy service that creates a reverse proxy to the pwa container - https://bit.ly/2HpZJDI
  # the reverse proxy connects the SSL/TLS certs created on the local file system into the nginx container
  # this allows the pwa container to be accessible over HTTPS
  # it also proxies requests to the configured domain running at the configured port for the pwa container
  pwa:
    # build pwa using the Dockerfile from the PWD

    # list of directories and files on the host system to volume mount into the container
    # changes made to files in the container and on the host file system are mapped to one another
    # this enables hot reloading from the container to detect changes made on the host file system
